RFM Segmentation Analysis
This project performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis on customer transaction data, segments customers based on their purchase behavior, and exports the results for further analysis. The code can be functionalized for repeated use and can export the results to a CSV file.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains transaction details from an online retail store. Each record includes information such as:

Invoice number
Product description
Quantity
Price
Customer ID
Invoice date
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pandas
Datetime
Excel file containing the retail data (online_retail_II.xlsx)
Key Steps in the Analysis
Data Preparation:

Missing values are removed.
Canceled transactions (invoices starting with "C") are excluded.
A Total Price column is created by multiplying Quantity with Price.
RFM Calculation:

Recency: The number of days since the customer's last purchase.
Frequency: The number of unique invoices associated with each customer.
Monetary Value: The total amount spent by each customer.
RFM Scoring:

Customers are segmented based on quintiles (from 1 to 5) for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, where:
Recency: 5 represents the most recent purchase, and 1 the least recent.
Frequency: 5 represents the most frequent, and 1 the least frequent.
Monetary Value: 5 represents the highest spenders, and 1 the lowest.
RFM Segmentation:

An RFM_SCORE is generated by combining the Recency and Frequency scores.
Based on this score, customers are segmented into categories such as champions, loyal_customers, new_customers, at_risk, etc., using a segmentation map.
Exporting Results:

The final DataFrame is exported as rfm.csv when the csv parameter is set to True.
